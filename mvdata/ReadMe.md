# Description

* Caltech101/20.
The dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus, and Perona 2007) consists of 101 categories of images. Following the work (Li et al. 2015), we select the widely used 2386 images of 20 classes and 9144 images of 102 classes (101 object categories and an additional background class), respectively, denoted as Caltech20 and Caltech101. There are 6 kinds of features to be extracted from all the images, i.e., 48-D (D: dimensions) Gabor, 40-D Wavelet moments, 254-D CENTRIST, 1984-D HOG, 512-D GIST, and 928-D LBP.

The datasets are large and could not get uploaded on GitHub. So they can be downloaded through
