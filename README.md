# MvNNcor
This is an implementation of Deep Embedded Complementary and Interactive Information for Multi-view Classification (MvNNcor) in Pytorch.

## Datasets
The model is trained on AWA/Caltech101/Reuters dataset, where each dataset are splited into three parts: 70% samples for training, two-thirds of the rest samples for validation, and one-third of that for testing. We utilize the classification accuracy to evaluate the performance of all the methods.
